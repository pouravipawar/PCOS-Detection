# PCOS Detection
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and prevalent endocrine disorder affecting a large and growing percentage of women globally. For PCOS to be effectively managed and related consequences to be avoided, early detection and prompt action are essential. The application of machine learning algorithms has made healthcare analytics redictively stronger. This work uses pertinent clinical data and machine learning algorithms to propose an integrated method for PCOS detection. The study's dataset includes 
an extensive compilation of clinical, hormonal, and lifestyle factors linked to PCOS patients. In order to ensure the quality and relevance of the input features, feature selection strategies and data preparation techniques are used.
